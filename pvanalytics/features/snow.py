    Estimate transmittance as the ratio of modeled effective irradiance to

    Measured irradiance should be in the array's plane and represent snow-free

    heated plane-of-array pyranometer. When necessary, the irradiance should be
    adjusted for reflections and spectral content.

    """
    Categorizes electrical behavior into a snow-related mode.

    Modes are defined in [1]_:

    * Mode -1: Indicates periods where it is unknown if and how snow impacts
      power output. Mode -1 includes periods when:

          1. voltage modeled with measured irradiance is below the inverter's
             turn-on voltage OR
          2. voltage modeled with measured irradiance exceeds the upper bound
             of the inverter's MPPT algorithm OR
          3. measured voltage exceeds the upper bound of the inverter's MPPT
             algorithm.

      Mode -1 is added in this function to cover a case that was not addressed
      in [1]_.

    * Mode 0: Indicates periods with enough opaque snow that the system is not
      producing power. Specifically, Mode 0 is when the measured voltage is
      below the inverter's turn-on voltage but the voltage modeled using
      measured irradiance is above the inverter's turn-on voltage.
    * Mode 1: Indicates periods when the system has non-uniform snow and
      both operating voltage and current are decreased. Operating voltage is
      reduced when bypass diodes activate and current is decreased due to
      decreased irradiance.
    * Mode 2: Indicates periods when the operating voltage is reduced but
      current is consistent with snow-free conditions.
    * Mode 3: Indicates periods when the operating voltage is consistent with
      snow-free conditionss but current is reduced.
    * Mode 4: Voltage and current are consistent with snow-free conditions.
