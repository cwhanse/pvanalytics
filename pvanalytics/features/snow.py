    Estimate transmittance as the ratio of modeled effective irradiance to

    Measured irradiance should be in the array's plane and represent snow-free
    conditions. For example, the measured irradiance could be obtained with a
    heated plane-of-array pyranometer. When necessary, the irradiance should be
    adjusted for reflections and spectral content.

        Plane-of-array irradiance absent the effect of snow. [W/m2]

    """
    Categorizes electrical behavior into a snow-related mode.

    Modes are defined in [1]_:

    * Mode 0: Indicates periods with enough opaque snow that the system is not
      producing power. Specifically, Mode 0 is when the measured voltage is
      below the inverter's turn-on voltage but the voltage modeled using
      measured irradiance is above the inverter's turn-on voltage.
    * Mode 1: Indicates periods when the system has non-uniform snow and
      both operating voltage and current are decreased. Operating voltage is
      reduced when bypass diodes activate and current is decreased due to
      decreased irradiance.
    * Mode 2: Indicates periods when the operating voltage is reduced but
      current is consistent with snow-free conditions.
    * Mode 3: Indicates periods when the operating voltage is consistent with
      snow-free conditionss but current is reduced.
    * Mode 4: Voltage and current are consistent with snow-free conditions.
    * Mode is None when both measured and voltage modeled from measured
      irradiance are below the inverter turn-on voltage.

    An additional mode was added to cover a case that was not addressed in
    [1]_:
    * Mode -1: Indicates periods where voltage modeled with measured irradiance
      is below the inverter's turn-on voltage. Under Mode -1, it is unknown if
      and how snow impacts power output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmp_ratio : array-like
        Ratio between measured voltage and voltage modeled using
        calculated values of transmission. [dimensionless]
    transmission : array-like
        Fraction of plane-of-array irradiance that can reach the array's cells
        through the snow cover. [dimensionless]
    measured_voltage : array-like
        Measured DC voltage. [V]
    modeled_voltage : array-like
        DC voltage modeled using measured plane-of-array irradiance and
        back-of-module temperature. [V]
    min_dcv : float
        The lower voltage bound on the inverter's maximum power point
        tracking (MPPT) algorithm. [V]
    threshold_vratio : float
        The lower bound for vratio that is representative of snow-free
        conditions. Determined empirically. Depends on system configuration and
        site conditions. [unitless]
    threshold_transmission : float
        The lower bound on transmission that is found under snow-free
        conditions, determined empirically. [unitless]
